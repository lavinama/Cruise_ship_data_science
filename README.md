# ML Model for Predicting Ships Crew Size

**Objective:** Build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers.

This project is covers four main topics:
1. data proprocessing and variable selection
2. basic regression model
3. hyper-parameters tuning
4. techniques for dimensionality reduction.

##### What does this projct show?
I am able to solve a data science problem while displaying my expertise in these areas:
* Feature standardization
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Cross-validation
* Techniques of dimensionality reduction such as PCA (principal component analysis) and Lasso regression
* Generalization error
* Uncertainty quantification
* Ability to use advanced data science techniques such as sklearn’s pipeline tool for model building.
* Ability to interpret your model in terms of real-life applications.
